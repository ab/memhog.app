Memhog
======

Memhog is a Flask application whose job is to run the system out of memory.

⚠️ This is very dangerous to run on your local computer! ⚠️

It's useful for finding out what happens in a server hosting environment when a
container runs out of memory. This is important if you want to test relevant
monitoring or alerting systems.

Many services do not handle this situation well, so use at your own risk!
